# Scrapy_Yomou_Server
Server for scrapy portion of Yomou!

Run the server by cd'ing into the root directory of this project and running the command `scrapyd`. Will need to have run `pip install scrapyd` and `pip install scrapy` first. Scrapyd will also need [PyWin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases) or the OS-specific equivalent.
